<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>
<p>OrderManager is written in Java 1.8 and is a relational database management system using Apache Derby. The database contains information about customers, products, inventory records, orders, and order records. The code here provides a foundation for a back-end for an application for managing products, product inventory, and customer orders for an online store. It keeps tracks of inventory for each product and orders placed by customers.</p>
<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>
<p>OrderManager class contains initialization of the database by creating instances of the other classes to handle connecting to the database, DDL, DML, and DQL. An instance of the API class is also created in OrderManager, enabling function calls to API methods. Currently, OrderManager is meant to test functionality of these other classes.</p>

<a id="tables" class="anchor" href="#tables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tables</h2>
<h3>
<a id="product" class="anchor" href="#product" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>product</h3>
<p>The product table represents a product in the database. A product has a vendor product SKU that uniquely identifies it, as well as a name and a description. Has a 1-to-1 relationship with inventory_record.</p>

<td><strong>product_SKU</strong></td>
<td>VARCHAR(12)</td>

The SKU is a 12-character value of the form "AA-NNNNNN-CC", where A is an upper-case letter, N is a digit from 0-9, and C is either a digit or an upper case letter. Example of a valid SKU: "AB-123456-0C". Validity of the SKU is checked by the stored function isSKU() defined by DBMS_storedfunc.java.</td>

<a id="inventory_record" class="anchor" href="#inventory_record" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>inventory_record</h3>
<p>The inventory_record table represents available inventory in the store. For each product, the inventory_record keeps track of the price and number of available units to order. Has a 1-to-1 relationship with product. This table is checked when an order is placed to make sure the number of units ordered is valid, and to get the price for that product.</p>

<h3>
<a id="orders" class="anchor" href="#orders" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>orders</h3>
<p>The orders table represents an order that is placed. Each order has an automatically generated order id, and an customer id that references the customer who placed that order. The table also contains the date of the order and date of shipment if the order has been shipped. The orders table does not contain information about what products are ordered, which is kept track of by the order_record table. It has a many-to-1 relationship with customer, and a 1-to-many relationship with order_record.</p>

<h3>
<a id="ordermanager" class="anchor" href="#ordermanager" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OrderManager</h3>
<p>Initializes the database and functions from other classes should be called in main.
Holds information about the database as private variables accessible to itself, with crucial
ones passed as parameters to other functions (most notably: Statement s and Connection conn).</p>
<h3>
<a id="ordermanager_connection" class="anchor" href="#ordermanager_connection" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OrderManager_Connection</h3>
<p>Establishes connection to the database and handles closing it. Should not need any changes or additions.</p>
<h3>
<a id="ordermanager_ddl" class="anchor" href="#ordermanager_ddl" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OrderManager_DDL</h3>
<p>Has functions to create all tables, triggers, and functions (and procedures, but we do not have any right now).
Also has functions to drop tables, triggers, and functions (and procedures, if we add any).
This is where we should edit if we want to change how tables are created, modify domain constraints, etc.</p>
<h3>
<a id="ordermanager_dml" class="anchor" href="#ordermanager_dml" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OrderManager_DML</h3>
<p>Handles insert, alter, and delete. Has functions to insert for customer, product, and inventory_record.
Will also truncate all tables to clear them of data.</p>
<h3>
<a id="ordermanager_dql" class="anchor" href="#ordermanager_dql" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OrderManager_DQL</h3>
<p>Contains functions that select for certain rows. Functions could use more work, particularly in modularizing them so that they don't just print to standard out (returning results in some way would be useful, especially if API could call on these functions directly). Useful functions that maybe should be in API are the selectAllAvailableProducts() and selectAllCustomerOrders() which display product names and inventory information and all orders of a specified customer, respectively.</p>
<h3>
<a id="ordermanager_api" class="anchor" href="#ordermanager_api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OrderManager_API</h3>
<p>Contains functions that should be primarily called upon by a user to interact with the database. Current functionality includes creating a customer, creating an order and order record for a specified customer, creating a product, and getting the total cost of a specific order.</p>
<h3>
<a id="dbms_storedfunc" class="anchor" href="#dbms_storedfunc" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DBMS_storedfunc</h3>
<p>Contains stored functions used by the OrderManager_DDL class when creating constraints. Does not need any more additions or changes.</p>
